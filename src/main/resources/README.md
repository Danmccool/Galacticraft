## Project Structure

- **src/main/generated:** Do not manually edit files in this directory, as it contains resources generated by the Gradle task `runDatagen`. Any changes made here will be overwritten during the next execution of the task.

- **src/main/resources:** Contains resources that may overwrite the generated folder.

## Data Generation

The `runDatagen` Gradle task is responsible for generating resources in the `src/main/generated` directory. This task should be executed whenever there are changes in the `src/main/resources` folder or any other datagen-related modifications.

### Running the Datagen Task

To run the `runDatagen` task, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew runDatagen
```
If you're using IntelliJ IDEA or an IDE that supports this, you can simply run the task from the Gradle tool window.
